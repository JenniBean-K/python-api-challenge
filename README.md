WeatherPy - Analysis

Overview:

In this Analysis we look at what the weather is like as we approach the equator.

I this project we use Python, APIs, and data visualization to explore how weather changes as we move toward the equator.

Instillation:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Go to the project folder.

Run the Analysis report.

Part 1: WeatherPy:

Goal:

Visualize weather data from over 500 cities and explore how it changes with latitude using the OpenWeatherMap API and Citipy Library.

Scatter Plots: 

    Latitude vs. Temperature

    Latitude vs. Humidity

    Latitude vs. Cloudiness

    Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Calculate Linear Regression split by Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

Part 2: VacationPy

Goal:

Plan future vacations using weather data with the Geopify API and geoViews Library.

Maps created that show the cities with their humidity levels.

Fnd ideal cities based on 

    Temperature between 21-27Â°C

    Wind speed less that 4.5 m/s 

    Zero cloudiness 

Search hotels near selected cities using Geopify API.

Map with city names, hotel names, and humidity information.
